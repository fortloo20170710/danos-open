/*
 * DANOS-Open Core: Backend Programming Interface (v0.9, ADR-0007)
 *
 * The contract between the desired-state store and dataplane backends
 * (kernel netlink, VPP, ...). The programming pipeline calls these ops
 * for every DESIRED object that is not yet PROGRAMMED; success moves
 * the object to PROGRAMMED.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - Ops must be idempotent (reconciler may re-issue them).
 *   - Ops may block briefly (netlink round trip) but not indefinitely.
 *   - Ops are called from the reconciler/programming thread only.
