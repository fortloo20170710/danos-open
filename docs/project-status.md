# DANOS Open Project Status

## 2026-10-05 pass: capability registry, conformance, release gate

CTest remains 38 tests, green under Debug, ASan+UBSan+LSan and TSan. This pass
closes two of the review's credibility findings.

**Capability registry (`e08c77e`).** The registry was dead code end to end:
`capability_registry.c` had no header, so its entry points were declared nowhere;
nothing called them; the VPP capability table's register function had no
declaration and no callers; and the scan relied on `danos_backend_get_info()`
eventually failing. The VPP adapter now registers its table at install time and
the scan is bounded. Because the table was corrected earlier to advertise only
what the adapter can program, wiring it is truthful — and a regression test
asserts interface/VRF/route are advertised while EVPN/MPLS/ACL/tunnel/multicast
are not, so it cannot be wired to a lying table.

**Conformance (`e08c77e`).** Two cases discarded their result and returned 0
unconditionally, which is how a "11/11" could be vacuous for features that did
not work at all. `conf_iface_crud` now runs the full lifecycle, reads back,
checks contents, checks a duplicate create is refused, and checks the delete
takes effect. `conf_capability_query` asserts a definite, stable answer.

**Release gate (`617433a`).** An environment-restricted lane was recorded as
`ENVIRONMENT-OPEN` without incrementing `failures`, so a release could be
declared with the DPDK hardware lane never run — the recorded evidence and the
gate's verdict could disagree unnoticed. An open lane now blocks by default;
the policy lives in its own script so it is unit-tested without executing every
lane, and `DANOS_RELEASE_ALLOW_OPEN_LANES=1` waives it deliberately with the
waiver written into the result file.

**Not done: transaction staging (item 2).** An implementation was attempted and
abandoned with 12 of 38 tests failing; the tree was reverted and nothing from it
remains. The attempt was useful: it established that the 51 CRUD entry points
are uniform enough to rewrite mechanically, that staging needs a read overlay
and not just a write overlay (a `create` then `read` in one transaction fails
otherwise), that the store signals existence through `DANOS_ERR_INVALID_ARG`
with a *valid* `out_size`, and that the three operations must not be collapsed
into a boolean or they lose their EXISTS / NOT_FOUND distinction. Those findings
are written up in the plan document so the next attempt starts from them.

**Build hygiene (`this pass`).** `build-asan/` — 57 compiled artefacts, 34 MB —
was tracked because `.gitignore` covered `build/`, `build-tsan/` and
`build-fuzz/` but not `build-asan/`. It and a compiled Go binary committed
alongside its own source are now untracked and ignored.

## 2026-10-04 fourth pass: gNMI POLL, unsupported nexthops

CTest remains 38 tests, green under Debug, ASan+UBSan+LSan and TSan.

**gNMI POLL (`d6ee6e9`).** POLL did not work as a mode. Every message arriving
on a POLL stream was handled as a fresh Subscribe, so each Poll re-sent the whole
initial set instead of a delta, and the notification and `sync_response` were
encoded into one gRPC message — invalid, since `SubscribeResponse` is a `oneof`
(the ONCE branch already sent them separately for that reason). Streams are now
tracked per stream id; the initial Subscribe sends the set and then the sync as
separate messages and leaves the stream open, a Poll answers with a notification
only, and a Poll before Subscribe is refused.

The STREAM change detector hashed only interface mtu and ifindex, so a change to
an interface name, admin state or address, or to a VRF name or a route prefix,
metric or next hop, left the hash identical and subscribers were never notified.
It also copied each type into a fixed array, so a larger store silently lost
objects. It now streams the store and folds the raw object bytes.

**Unsupported nexthops (`ff2101a`).** LABEL, EVPN, SEG6 and SEG6LOCAL were
consumed for length but never interpreted, so an EVPN or SR-TE route was
installed as an ordinary IPv4 route — silently forwarding where it should not,
and contradicting the capability table. Such routes are now refused. Two related
defects in the same loop are fixed: the gateway was copied at the route family's
width rather than the nexthop type's, and a blackhole nexthop became an empty
nexthop in a group instead of setting `DANOS_ROUTE_FLAG_BLACKHOLE`.

Writing that test surfaced something worth recording: `zapi_mapper.c` carries
**two ZAPI route dialects**. `zapi_map_route` decodes a simplified layout used
by the mock path; `zapi_dispatch_frr` decodes the native FRR layout and is what
real FRR traffic actually takes. The nexthop corrections went into the native
path. The simplified dialect has no flags field and cannot carry this
information, so the two will keep diverging until it is retired.

## 2026-10-04 third pass: authentication, FRR decode, golden bytes

CTest is now 38 tests, green under Debug, ASan+UBSan+LSan and TSan.

**Authentication (`0d3f9e7`).** The previous pass added authorization but left
nothing to authorize: with no credential source the role was the configured
default, so RBAC could not deny anything. Two dependency-free sources now exist
- a bearer token file (RFC 6750, constant-time compare, refused outright if
group- or other-readable) and `SO_PEERCRED` on a unix socket (uid 0 → admin).
gNMI authenticates per RPC and answers `grpc-status 16`; NETCONF captures the
credential from `<hello>` and authenticates per session. mgrd refuses to start
if a configured token file is unusable, and `DANOS_AUTHZ_REQUIRE_AUTH` makes a
missing credential source fatal. **There is still no transport security**, so a
bearer token crosses the wire in cleartext; mTLS remains open.

Also fixed a real race this exposed: `rbac.c`'s `g_initialized` was a plain bool
written by init and read by every request thread, which 32 concurrent
connections turned into a TSAN data race.

**Transaction atomicity (`a875ea0`) — mechanism only, not done.**
`danos_object_apply_batch()` applies a set of mutations under a single store
write-lock acquisition, so a reader or the reconciler sees none or all of a
change set rather than half a configuration. Nothing stages yet and commit does
not call it, so runtime behaviour is unchanged. The remaining work - routing
the DPA CRUD entry points through it, a read-your-writes overlay, and
per-object version counters for conflict detection - is called out explicitly in
the plan document.

**FRR decode (`41e866d`).** Two tables in `zapi_mapper.c`/`zapi_parse.c` were
wrong, now derived from upstream FRR 10.3. Nexthop types follow
`enum nexthop_types_t`; `zserv_encode_nexthop()` writes the trailing ifindex for
both IPv4 forms and both IPv6 forms, and the decoder read it only for type 3, so
every type-2 nexthop left four bytes unread and desynchronised the rest of the
message. Types 4-6 were skipped without consuming their payload. Route
protocols follow `lib/route_types.txt`, where declaration order is the value:
the old table mapped 8→ISIS and 11→OSPF, but 8 is OSPF6 and 11 is PIM, and
ISIS (9) and OSPF (7) were not mapped at all.

**Golden bytes (`2f542b2`, `3cd10d6`).** `test_zapi_golden.c` and
`test_vpp_golden.c` replace literal payloads with encoders transcribed from
upstream, so the decoders must agree with an implementation written from the
specification rather than from the decoder. This closes item 11's main gap;
what remains is generating those encoders mechanically rather than by hand.

## 2026-10-04 second pass: transport, reconciler, authorization

Follow-on work against `docs/outstanding-work-plan.md`. CTest is now 36 tests,
green under Debug, ASan+UBSan+LSan and TSan.

**gRPC transport (`a90d87b`).** Five defects in `gnmi_grpc.c`:
flow-control windows were kept in `stream_window[stream % 64]`, so stream 1 and
stream 65 shared one budget; `SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE` was applied as an
absolute value instead of the RFC 7540 §6.9.2 delta; `WINDOW_UPDATE` was read but
never sent, so any request body over 64 KiB deadlocked the connection; the
parked-frame queue was LIFO and unbounded, reversing multi-frame gRPC messages;
and the subscription registry and its queues were shared with the event-callback
thread without a lock, so poll raced the producer and `unsubscribe` freed an
entry a callback was still writing to.

**Reconciler (`d8dc21c`).** `danos_reconciler_run_once()` never called the
tombstone sweep, so deleting an interface or route left it live in the dataplane
for the lifetime of the process. Failed objects were retried on every 50 ms
tick, so a route whose next hop had not been learned hammered the backend
forever. The sweep now runs in both reconciler modes, and failures back off
exponentially up to `backoff_max_ms`, stop after `max_retries`, and park an
oscillating object — `max_retries`, `backoff_*` and `antiflap_*` were previously
read into the config struct and never referenced. `total_runs` is now counted in
both modes; the daemon runs without a state store, so the exported reconciler
counters had been zero in production.

**Authorization (`3e58c6a`).** `danos-security` is linked into `danos-mgrd` for
the first time. `danos-mgmt/src/authz` authorizes once per northbound RPC
(gRPC `grpc-status 7`, NETCONF `access-denied`) and appends every decision and
transaction lifecycle event to the audit log. The daemon initializes both before
accepting a request. **This is not authentication**: there is still no credential
to authorize, so the role is the configured default and
`DANOS_AUTHZ_DEFAULT_ROLE=operator|viewer` can lock the daemon down ahead of
TLS. What it buys is that adding an identity source is a change to one function
rather than to every handler.

**VPP wire formats (`d8e231b`).** Corrected against VPP's own implementation
after an external commit (`7bc91a3`) had reverted part of the earlier work. Two
distinct mechanisms were being conflated:

- Regular API messages use vlapi's length-driven encoder. `admin_up_down` is a
  `u8` (a 4-byte field puts a zero in the byte VPP reads, so an interface could
  never come admin-up), and a `string` is a `u32` length plus exactly that many
  bytes with **no padding** — `vl_api_to_api_string()` returns `len + sizeof(u32)`.
- The two legacy socket control messages are exchanged as raw structs. VPP's own
  client writes the client name as a fixed zero-padded 64-byte buffer, the server
  reads it with `%s`, and the reply's message table is filled with
  `strncpy_s(..., 64, ...)` with no length ever written.

`string name [64]` in `memclnt.api` states the abstract type; the `[64]` is a
capacity, and on the socket-control path the wire form is fixed-width. This has
been got wrong in both directions, which is the argument for plan item 11
(byte-level fixtures generated from VPP itself). Both facts are recorded in
`docs/security-and-correctness-hardening-2026-10-04.md` §4.5.

**Verification status of the recorded VPP evidence is unchanged and still open.**
`docs/security-and-correctness-hardening-2026-10-04.md` records a live smoke
against `vpp v26.10-rc0~545-gad99177fe` reporting PASS, but no artefact from that
run is in the repository (ISO digest, serial capture, or log), so it cannot be
reproduced or checked from here — VPP is not installed in this environment. Until
a run leaves a verifiable artefact, VPP protocol and FIB claims should be read as
mock-only. Plan item 3 covers this.

## 2026-10-04 hardening pass

A P0 remediation pass closed the remotely reachable memory-safety defects, fixed
a persistence path that silently dropped every route, and corrected three VPP
binary-API wire encodings that did not match VPP's `.api` definitions. Full
record, including the five further defects found while writing the regression
tests: `docs/security-and-correctness-hardening-2026-10-04.md`.

Sanitizer status moved from red to green on `main`:

| Build | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Debug | 35/35 | 35/35 |
| ASan + UBSan + LSan | 20/35 | **35/35** |
| TSan | 32/35 | **35/35** |

Seven new test functions were added, each verified to fail against the unfixed
code. Notable corrections: routes are now durable across restart (previously no
route was ever written to the WAL); VPP binary-API operations now match the
Debian trixie VPP 26.10 runtime; and any gNMI
`Set` carrying a delete no longer crashes the server.

**This pass invalidated part of the earlier mock-only evidence.** A real VPP
26.10-rc0 runtime smoke has now independently passed socket registration,
control_ping, interface admin-up, ECMP route add/delete and stats-segment query;
see `docs/security-and-correctness-hardening-2026-10-04.md`. This validates
runtime API/FIB programming only, not packet forwarding/ECMP distribution or
DPDK performance. The physical I211 forwarding/ECMP result remains unaccepted
for the independent second-link/peer-topology failure.

Remaining work is tracked in `docs/outstanding-work-plan.md`. The two items that
gate any real deployment are TLS/authentication on the management plane, and
giving the transaction engine actual atomicity.

## Current assessment

Latest general LIVE/polling runner (2026-10-04) remains r13:
`build/danos-open-v0.16.0-rc1-i211-dpdk-polling-runner-r13.iso`, SHA256
`2e19f2a26314222251bbd2a01545837207407e4d1190f594199007fd03e9720e`, clean source
commit `88f4bed22f2490e8aaeb081d015243636f538cb6`. Embedded I211 profile validation,
QEMU runtime ping-plugin query, USB keyboard/mgrd replay, ttyS0 shell and serial-capture PTY tests pass. The
latest physical I211 traffic candidate is r4 from fix commit `9955ef7` (SHA256
`311d63d0ce8c8b59c5448cdc7add742f185ddd9e49b61f8433ffe7a84afdef68`); it has now booted on the
physical host after USB write/read-back verification. Interactive UART confirmed the exact
embedded commit/ISO/profile identity. `/run/dpdk-pci-bind.failed` is absent;
`/tmp/dpdk-pci-bind.log` reports PASS for `0000:01:00.0` and `0000:02:00.0`, both bound to
`uio_pci_generic`; `0000:03:00.0` and `0000:04:00.0` remain unbound. This closes the r3
overbinding/bind-error defect on hardware. VPP exposes both I211 ports, but only port 1 has
carrier (1 Gbps); port 2 is carrier-down. Boot traffic logs show 3/3 loss on each initial peer
ping, 3/3 loss for ECMP probes, and 1000/1000 loss in the soak probe. Thus physical PCI binding
is PASS, while physical packet forwarding/ECMP is not yet accepted; connect/configure both
independent peer links and return routes before rerunning. This is not a throughput result. The
previous USB media had LBA 0 write and unrecovered-read errors; it must not be reused.
The 2026-10-04 physical LIVE traffic attempt reached the BusyBox root shell and started VPP;
serial output included `LIVE-SHELL-READY` and `SERIAL-SHELL-READY`. Its identity markers
(`DANOS-INIT-ENTER`, `DANOS-BUILD`, PCI bind inventory) were not captured, so the exact ISO
digest/commit is unverified. The initial recorder classified the partial capture as SKIP; its
parser now preserves explicit failure evidence as `FAIL` with `identity_status=UNVERIFIED`.
Replay of this log fails as expected, while recorder tests 7/7 and CTest 35/35 pass. The visible
traffic probe itself failed: all four ECMP destinations had 5 sent/0 received, FIB had one bucket, and path
failover/restore failed. Only the first interface showed packet counters and it negotiated
100 Mbps. Physical startup is observed, but two-link forwarding/ECMP is currently FAIL for this
attempt; PCI performance remains ENVIRONMENT-OPEN. Raw log:
`build/i211-live-traffic-20261004.serial.log`. No USB write was performed from this host during
this run; the previously faulty USB media remains unsuitable. Retest after confirming two
independent peer links at 10.10.0.2/24 and 10.20.0.2/24, peer responses/routes for
30.30.30.2–.5 and return path to 30.30.30.1, and carrier on both I211 ports. A fresh serial
cold-boot capture with build identity is required to qualify the exact image.

Initial passive capture for traffic-runner r3 (`6287fba`, SHA256
`0715ebacfd9bb76f4ec822793b6d551f805311b44bf732abf031db20a4c638fb`) was written to USB by
the user and the I211 machine was rebooted successfully. The passive CH340 capture did not
produce a usable cold-boot transcript: it contained repeated BusyBox prompt/banner fragments
and ANSI `ESC[6n`, but no `DANOS-INIT-ENTER`, `DANOS-BUILD`, PCI bind diagnostics, or traffic
result markers. That passive recorder result was `SKIP`, `identity_status=UNVERIFIED`; the noisy
raw capture was discarded. A later interactive, read-only UART session recovered the embedded
identity and decisive diagnostics: commit `6287fba`, `/run/dpdk-pci-bind.failed` present, and
`/tmp/dpdk-pci-bind.log` reports `bind=0000:01:00.0 ... rc=1` even though that BDF is attached
to `uio_pci_generic`. All four I211 BDFs (`01:00.0`–`04:00.0`) were attached to UIO although
the ISO selected only `01:00.0` and `02:00.0`. VPP exposed both ports; port 1 was carrier-up at
1 Gbps, port 2 was carrier-down. The traffic test was intentionally SKIPped because the bind
failure marker existed; no packet/ECMP result was produced. This is a physical **FAIL** of the
r3 PCI binding gate, not a dataplane PASS/FAIL. Root cause was adding the PCI ID globally via
`uio_pci_generic/new_id` after setting per-device `driver_override`: kernel auto-probe attached
matching devices, then the explicit bind returned an error. The official DPDK bind helper uses
`driver_override` instead of global `new_id` when available
([dpdk-devbind.py](https://github.com/DPDK/dpdk/blob/main/usertools/dpdk-devbind.py)).

Fix `9955ef7` removes global `new_id` from the modern per-device path, fails closed when
`driver_override` is unavailable, and treats a bind write error as success only if sysfs proves
the requested driver attached. Its ISO, r4 (`build/danos-open-v0.16.0-rc1-i211-dpdk-traffic-runner-r4.iso`),
SHA256 `311d63d0ce8c8b59c5448cdc7add742f185ddd9e49b61f8433ffe7a84afdef68`, passed profile and
provenance validation and QEMU ttyS0 identity smoke; CTest is 35/35 and the full release gate
on `9955ef7` passed (`build/v016-release-gate-9955ef7.env`). Physical r4 now confirms the
selected-device bind gate on the I211 host. PCI performance remains OPEN pending a valid
connected peer topology and traffic measurement.

The complete unified v0.16 release gate was rerun on clean commit `9955ef7` and passed:
`build/v016-release-gate-9955ef7.env`. Backend contract, CTest 35/35, QEMU USB HID/mgrd
recovery, ttyS0 root shell/runtime plugin, topology-140 FRR/VPP lifecycle and four-flow ECMP
(4000/4000, 0% loss, bucket deltas 3000/1000), and VMware VMXNET3 two-path packets
(2000/2000, 0% loss) all passed. PCI preflight correctly returned structured `SKIP` /
`ENVIRONMENT-OPEN` because this development host has no target PCI runner. This gate does not
change the physical r3 binding failure or qualify physical r4.

The subsequent controlled cold boot captured the complete r1 identity and all four I211 BDFs.
It exposed an earlier blocker: binding the first target (`0000:01:00.0`) to `uio_pci_generic`
failed (`DPDK-PCI-BIND-RESULT FAIL rc=1`). VPP API/stats sockets became ready, but the first
peer ping failed; this run therefore did not reach valid DPDK forwarding acceptance. The strict
result is `build/i211-live-reboot-20261004-2.serial.log.traffic.env` (`FAIL`, bind failure), with
raw UART at `build/i211-live-reboot-20261004-2.serial.log`. Next instrument the failed sysfs bind
state and kernel messages before changing the device-binding procedure; then verify peer
return routes using the physical runbook.

Diagnostic traffic ISO r2 (`ccb71fc`, SHA256
`1605cd9c714adb7d5ae25a3cf10772d2f977ddcb82965718df4d165f6969cced`) adds sysfs and kernel-log
context at bind failure. Follow-up r3 (`6287fba46c54eb38edf21f0ffc4628e612a8efab`, SHA256
`0715ebacfd9bb76f4ec822793b6d551f805311b44bf732abf031db20a4c638fb`) also skips the long traffic
sequence after PCI bind failure. r3 profile/provenance and QEMU ttyS0 shell/runtime plugin checks
pass; CTest is 35/35. Subsequent interactive UART inspection of physical r3 recovered its
identity and showed the bind failure/overbinding documented above; no r3 traffic qualification
was run. The fix is in commit `9955ef7`; physical r4 retest is pending USB transfer.

The full unified gate on clean commit `ed8b4b5` passed and is recorded in
`build/v016-release-gate-ed8b4b5.env`: CTest 35/35, backend contract, r13 and traffic ISO
profiles, traffic UART PTY pipeline, runtime plugin, QEMU console/recovery, strict
topology-140 4000/4000 ECMP, and VMware 2000/2000 packet regression. PCI remains
schema-v1 `SKIP`/`ENVIRONMENT-OPEN` (no target BDF; HugePages=0).
The gate starts the r13 VPP profile under QEMU and queries `vppctl show plugins` over
ttyS0, requiring `ping_plugin.so` in runtime output. Traffic ISO r1 is built from clean
`72dcd8b`, SHA256 `21df44a26e0b7c92d89a58e705329c0c2e6f1dad821a43d348ae1d70c2097aab`;
its physical traffic remains untested pending a healthy USB and peer topology. The
gate now extracts the ISO initramfs and verifies both VPP plugins, traffic flag,
dynamic-ARP configuration, soak settings and startup.conf, not just build metadata.
An independent I211 traffic-runner builder and UART result recorder are available
for physical two-link ping, ECMP soak, and path withdraw/restore functional evidence;
the qualification profile uses dynamic ARP instead of fixture MACs. Those ICMP rates
are explicitly not line-rate qualification, and no physical run is claimed yet.

Fresh unified gate rerun on 2026-10-04 against current HEAD
`bac716ee1cd497cd02daa644788852b0e6fba9f3` is recorded in
`build/v016-release-gate-bac716e.env` (overall PASS) and
`build/v016-dpdk-bac716e.env` (structured SKIP). It reconfirms backend contract,
CTest 35/35, QEMU USB keyboard/mgrd WAL replay 3/3, ttyS0 shell and runtime
`ping_plugin.so`, topology-140 FRR/VPP add/withdraw/restart/replay, 4000/4000
QEMU ECMP packets with 0% loss (82.08 pps; bucket deltas 3000/1000), and VMware
2000/2000 with 0% loss (98.23 pps). PCI remains ENVIRONMENT-OPEN: no target BDF
or HugePages and this host only has RTL8168. The currently attached USB is still
the previously faulty serial `121220160204`; it was not written. Traffic-r1 ISO
profile/hash and the serial PTY/recorder path pass, but there is no new physical
boot or dataplane evidence.

A targeted local PCI preflight was also run with `DPDK_PCI_BDF=0000:04:00.0`
against the traffic-runner ISO. Its machine-readable result is
`build/v016-dpdk-22f9f96-local-rtl8168.env`: `SKIP`, correctly identifying
vendor/device `10ec:8168`, bound driver `r8169` rather than the requested
`vfio-pci`, and zero HugePages. This confirms the local RTL8168 cannot stand in
for the remote I211 qualification lane; no driver unbind/rebind was attempted.

After tightening the PCI performance recorder, a fresh full gate on clean commit
`997fa25` passed: `build/v016-release-gate-997fa25.env` (PCI sub-result
`build/v016-dpdk-997fa25.env` remains structured `SKIP`/`ENVIRONMENT-OPEN`). The
recorder now cross-checks PPS against packet count and duration, Mbps against
64-byte frame rate, and rejects out-of-range acceptance thresholds; its 11 unit
tests pass. Backend contract, CTest 35/35, QEMU/FRR/VPP recovery/ECMP and VMware
packet baseline were rerun by the same gate and passed.

The subsequent shared-Mbps-schema change was verified on clean commit `94c98e0`:
`build/v016-release-gate-94c98e0.env` passes in full, including the now-8-test
VMware recorder suite and its explicit 98-byte MAC-frame Mbps formula check.
The latest full gate was rerun against clean docs HEAD `ac196ce` and is recorded
in `build/v016-release-gate-ac196ce.env`; it also passes in full, with QEMU
4000/4000 (82.08 pps, bucket delta 3000/1000), VMware 2000/2000 (98.23 pps),
CTest 35/35, and PCI explicitly `SKIP`/`ENVIRONMENT-OPEN`.

Passive USB-UART diagnosis on the development host found `/dev/ttyUSB0` is a
CH340 (`1a86:7523`) at 115200 8N1 with no competing process, but receives only
the repeating byte pair `0x07 0xc0` (0% printable bytes). Sampling at 115200,
57600, 38400, 19200 and 9600 baud produced the same pattern. No shell commands
were sent and no valid DANOS serial marker was observed; this is not physical
boot evidence. The UART cable/target port/RX-TX-GND path must be checked before
the automated recorder can qualify a physical boot.

As of 2026-10-04, DANOS-Open v0.16 is in integration/release qualification. The
management-plane, frozen Route/NH/NHGroup contract, FRR 10.3 ZAPI path,
VPP 26.10 API/FIB path, route lifecycle, ECMP, QEMU e1000 and VMware
VMXNET3 polling-only lanes are covered by repeatable evidence. The remaining
item is a host-dependent real PCI/line-rate DPDK performance lane; protocol
extensions remain deliberately deferred. The latest clean-source QEMU
topology-140 additionally passes a four-flow 4000-packet ECMP soak (0% loss),
both bucket counter deltas, explicit next-hop withdraw/restore, dynamic BGP
add/withdraw, FRR/zserv restart, and VPP restart/replay. CTest is 35/35 and
the backend contract gate passes all three stages. An interface
admin-down alone does not withdraw a configured static route's next hop here;
the tested failover action is route/NH withdrawal.

The strongest capabilities are the DPA object/store/transaction foundation,
WAL persistence, desired-to-programmed reconciliation, model-driven
gNMI/CLI/NETCONF integration, Linux and VPP adapters, FRR ZAPI integration,
observability and automated protocol/quality tests. The primary external
dependency is a real VFIO/uio-bound DPDK runner; it is tracked as an
environment gate and is not conflated with software dataplane acceptance.

The current mainline is clean and synchronized with `origin/main`; `v0.16.0-rc1`
is the current release-candidate tag (the latest
formal release remains `v0.14.0`). The complete deterministic suite passes
35/35, including fail-closed I211 PCI binding checks. The backend contract gate also passes its capability/transaction,
programming-pipeline, and composite-route stages. The live ISO loads USB
host-controller and HID modules and binds its shell to tty1 with a controlling
terminal. The latest generated clean-provenance I211 polling runner image is
`build/danos-open-v0.16.0-rc1-i211-dpdk-polling-runner-r10.iso`, SHA256
`3ca6864ddf82a122703e9eb32a894ba23800f15cd96cf7a58f24f0707abe48ce`, built
from clean commit `eee79ce`. It configures BDFs `0000:01:00.0` and
`0000:02:00.0` with RX interrupts disabled and binds only PCI-ID-verified I211
functions to `uio_pci_generic`; USB HID/controller modules are included, and
ttyS0 now hosts an interactive root recovery shell. Strict QEMU checks prove
ttyS0 command execution (separate input echo/result) and USB keyboard command
input to tty1; mgrd WAL replay/backend counters pass. A targeted QEMU shell command
also verified `show plugins` lists `ping_plugin.so` and `vppctl ping` is recognized;
QEMU had no VPP dataplane interface, so its ping result was `0 sent` and is not a
connectivity PASS. Without I211, QEMU correctly reports
the requested BDF absent; identity-bound QEMU preflight is `SKIP`, as expected.
A serial-log recorder now verifies identity
and both port-bind markers without turning absent hardware into a pass. On
2026-10-03 the user confirmed successful physical boot, and an interactive
USB-UART read-only snapshot independently verified r9 identity, both I211 BDFs
bound to `uio_pci_generic`, VPP 26.10/mgrd running, all three VPP sockets, and
polling queue initialization. Port 1 carrier is up at 1 Gbps; port 2 has no
carrier. The configured route has two next hops but only one active forwarding
bucket while port 2 is down. Incidental broadcast/multicast RX is not an
end-to-end forwarding test; physical packet forwarding, ECMP distribution,
keyboard input and line-rate performance remain open gates.
The r10 image has not yet been booted on the physical runner. Its predecessor r9
used PCI ID `8086:1539`, both explicit BDFs,
`uio_pci_generic`, and polling-only RX. A 60-second passive USB-UART capture
received 0 bytes and correctly returned `SKIP` because the machine was already
booted. A later interactive read-only UART session verified the live runtime;
see the acceptance matrix for the saved snapshot and exact scope. Physical
traffic/performance qualification remains pending. The r9 image lacked
`ping_plugin.so`, so it could not run VPP CLI ICMP tests; r10 fixes that gap and
passed QEMU plugin loading. Physical r10 traffic/performance qualification is
pending. Writing r10 to the original runner USB failed with kernel medium/write
errors at LBA 0 and unrecovered read errors; the media contents are unverified.
No further write was attempted; a healthy replacement USB is required.
`capture_i211_serial.sh` now captures a bounded 115200 8N1 USB-UART boot log and
produces the identity-bound preflight result without overwriting prior evidence.
Its end-to-end PTY test validates file/result plumbing only, not physical hardware.
Privileged evidence is recorded separately from the DPDK hardware gate.
The same QEMU serial gate now restarts `mgrd` against its existing WAL and
checks both record recovery and backend replay counters (3 attempted, 3 OK,
0 failed), followed by gNMI/metrics listener recovery.
An audit found the r6/r7 serial verifier counted echoed input as success. r8
passes the corrected verifier requiring a separate command-result output; QEMU
USB keyboard input and mgrd restart/replay also pass. The physical USB-UART
capture was 0 bytes with no init marker, so physical boot and keyboard behavior
remain unresolved. The PCI
preflight against the requested I211 BDF returns `SKIP` here because this host
does not expose that device and has zero HugePages; no I211 performance result
has been recorded.
An additional 600-second passive `/dev/ttyUSB0` capture using r8 also received
zero bytes and produced `SKIP` (no `DANOS-INIT-ENTER`); the physical target did
not reboot/send serial output during the window. Local PCI inventory confirms
only Intel Wi-Fi and RTL8168, not the remote I211 runner.

## Evidence snapshot

- Latest formal release: `v0.14.0`; current release candidate: `v0.16.0-rc1`.
- The authoritative v0.16 status is maintained in
  `docs/v0.16-acceptance-matrix.md`; historical gaps below are retained only
  for traceability and do not override that matrix.
- Latest integrated gate: `build/v016-release-gate-ac196ce.env` is PASS on
  commit `ac196ce`. It includes backend contract, validators, PTY capture, CTest
  35/35, QEMU ttyS0/USB keyboard/mgrd replay, strict topology-140 FRR/VPP and
  mandatory 4×1000 ECMP soak, plus VMware 2000/2000 packet baseline (98.23 pps,
  0% loss). QEMU measured 4000/4000, 82.08 pps, bucket deltas 3000/1000.
  PCI preflight is structured `SKIP`/`ENVIRONMENT-OPEN` because the gate had no
  target BDF; the full gate PASS does not claim physical PCI performance.
  `run_v016_release_gate.sh` refuses `QEMU_ECMP_SOAK_REQUIRED` other than `1`
  and refuses a per-flow soak below 1000 packets, preventing environment
  overrides from silently weakening release acceptance. Both rejection cases
  were checked (exit 2); the full gate passed with the required defaults.
- Latest strict FRR/VPP integration evidence: commit `b5ce9f9`, ISO
  `build/danos-vpp-dpdk-e1000-2port-ecmp-soak-r4.iso`, SHA256
  `e164149ea4ce7e7b78f1c783c24412e24c11a8af896c406c67c4d865d1273097`, with
  `source_dirty=0`; fresh-guest topology-140 manifest and serial logs are under
  `build/qemu-frr-vpp-topology-140-soak-serialized/`. The strict verifier passes
  4000/4000 ECMP soak packets, bucket deltas 3000/1000, next-hop withdrawal and
  restore, BGP ZAPI add/withdraw, OSPF, FRR/zserv restart and VPP restart/replay.
  Aggregate QEMU soak rate is 82.08 pps and is a functional baseline, not line rate.
- Earlier strict FRR/VPP integration evidence: commit `9d1eb81`, ISO
  `build/danos-vpp-dpdk-e1000-2port-frr-ecmp-ready-r28.iso`, SHA256
  `245e97b922cb85646eac046a06c80fe432e715e231f61f7727bdebede01fc59a`, with
  `source_dirty=0`; fresh-guest topology-134 manifest, serial logs and pcap are
  under `build/qemu-frr-vpp-topology-134/`. The strict verifier passes direct
  ping, ECMP two-bucket/multi-flow, next-hop withdraw/restore, ZAPI, dynamic BGP
  add/withdraw, OSPF, FRR/zserv restart and VPP replay assertions.
- Reproducible integration-image profile is
  `danos-test/qemu/build_frr_ecmp_iso.sh`; it enables the trixie VPP runtime,
  two-port e1000 DPDK, `ping_plugin`, traffic peer gate, FRR ZAPI bridge and VPP
  restart test as one profile. Initial direct peer pings use five bounded
  complete-probe attempts to tolerate guest dataplane convergence; ECMP and
  path-failover packet-loss assertions remain strict.
- Current mainline work includes v0.14 release automation, compatibility baselines, event-driven reconciliation and streaming telemetry.
- The current configured build registers 35 CTest cases. The restricted development environment initially blocked seven socket/network tests, but the same build passed all 34 original cases when re-run with host network privileges; the added PCI binding safety test also passes. The restriction is therefore environmental, not a current test failure.
- The programming pipeline and composite route tests pass in the current environment.
- K4/K5 was closed in a privileged Docker validation container: K4a/K4b,
  standard gNMI-to-mgrd K5a, and real raw-ICMP forwarding all pass. The
  validation script now handles minimal images without `ping` and no longer
  duplicates veth address configuration.
- VPP protocol interop is implemented and the local VPP protocol suite passes.
  A Debian trixie native-source runtime was built as VPP
  `26.10-rc0~545-gad99177fe`; its API socket, stat socket, and DPA
  conformance (11/11) all pass. DPDK mlx4/mlx5 drivers are intentionally
  disabled for this software/Linux validation image.
- clang/libFuzzer was closed in a Debian Docker toolchain container: clang 19
  built `fuzz_decoders`, and the target ran 10,000 inputs successfully. The
  local host still intentionally has no clang installation.
- The repository now contains the trixie source-build and privileged runtime
  validation assets; no bookworm VPP packages are mixed into trixie.
- Real VPP CLI and API validation prove a two-path IPv4 ECMP FIB lifecycle:
  API handshake, control ping, interface flags, route add/delete, stat segment,
  and CLI two-bucket load-balance inspection all pass against VPP 26.10.
- Packet-level VPP forwarding is verified in a privileged trixie container:
  two Linux namespaces crossed two VPP af_packet interfaces with bidirectional
  ICMP success (the initial ARP-learning packet may be lost).
- FRR trixie topology baseline is verified: BGP EVPN reaches Established and
  OSPF reaches Full/2-Way; the existing OSPF/LDP acceptance also confirms
  ldpd is running and configured. The live FRR ZAPI → DPA → VPP route
  lifecycle is verified in the privileged trixie topology below.
- The 3-node FRR BGP/ECMP and OSPF convergence scripts pass with ping
  reachability. WAL/DPA restart recovery V3/V4 and the 1000-object transaction
  scale test also pass. The privileged software forwarding baseline records
  0.4363 Mpps; it is below the VPP+DPDK target and is not treated as a VPP
  dataplane failure.
- Real FRR zebra ZAPI reachability, FRR 10.3 registration, route commands
  31/32, native weighted multipath decoding and DPA/VPP programming are
  verified. A real static add/delete, two resolved ECMP paths, VPP ping
  5/5 with 0% loss, and programmed-ledger withdrawal all pass. The bridge
  also replays desired routes after an idle VPP restart probe.
- The VPP image contains `dpdk_plugin.so`, but the active validation runtime
  does not load DPDK and exposes no PCI dataplane device. The VPP+DPDK lane is
  therefore environment-blocked, not a passed performance result.
- 2026-09-22 QEMU/Debian-trixie guest validation closed the software DPDK
  lane: Debian kernel `uio.ko` and `uio_pci_generic.ko` are bundled, two QEMU
  e1000 devices are bound by VPP DPDK, API/stats sockets are ready, both
  interfaces are up, and a two-path `30.30.30.0/24` load-balance FIB is
  installed and reproduced after two guest restarts. QEMU VMXNET3 (`15ad:07b0`)
  is enumerated and UIO-bound, but its interface-control path still triggers
  QEMU VMXNET3 `cafe000f`/VPP instability; it is not counted as passed traffic.
- FRR 10.3 standard `frrinit.sh` startup (`watchfrr + zebra + mgmtd +
  staticd`) was reproduced in a privileged container. The live bridge now
  subscribes to `ZEBRA_ROUTE_STATIC=3` by default and accepts native route
  notifications (9/10) as well as FRR redistribute notifications (31/32).
  A static route replay reached the bridge (`processed=1`); VPP programming
  still requires a matching live-interface ifindex map in the same topology.
- The previous topology-89 gate was reported PASS by a permissive packet
  verifier. Rechecking its retained serial log with the strict verifier exposed
  path-0 packet loss and incomplete ECMP responses; it is no longer the packet
  acceptance source of truth.
- Historical clean Debian trixie topology-110, running source commit `4c658d7`, passed the strict QEMU verifier end to end:
  two direct pings; four ECMP targets at 3/3 replies and 0% loss; both bucket
  counters; BGP add/withdraw; OSPF Full/DR; FRR route add/withdraw/restore;
  FRR/zserv restart; VPP restart/replay. Its manifest and serial evidence are
  under `build/qemu-frr-vpp-topology-110/`; the test ISO digest is recorded in
  that manifest.
- VMware Workstation VMXNET3 polling-only packet baseline passes on two
  independent subnets from clean source commit `b9c4020`: 1000 packets per path,
  2000/2000 received, 0% loss, 98.23 pps, p50/p99 206/449 µs, and serial-captured
  VPP ECMP bucket counters 9/1003. This is a low-rate two-flow regression
  baseline, not a load-balance fairness, line-rate, or CPU-throughput claim.
- Diagnostic QEMU topology-102/104/106/107 runs exposed readiness races,
  stale listeners on reused FRR disks, and asymmetric ECMP return paths. The
  harness now uses an isolated readiness port gated on the remote BGP prefix,
  and ECMP probes use a loopback source with explicit per-peer return routes.
  The clean topology-110 run closes these packet and lifecycle checks under
  the strict verifier; older failed runs remain diagnostic evidence only.
- QEMU VMXNET3 DPDK and native VMXNET3 interrupt-mode results remain explicit
  FAIL boundaries: DPDK initialization SIGSEGV and native `No sufficient
  interrupt lines (0)`. The only accepted VMXNET3 path is VMware polling-only.
- Current host DPDK preflight is structured `SKIP`: VPP binary/plugin are
  present, but this host exposes no target PCI Ethernet BDF and has zero
  HugePages. No QEMU or VMware packet baseline is counted as real PCI line-rate
  performance.
- The common output schema for QEMU, VMware and PCI lanes is implemented in
  `docs/v0.16-performance-result-schema.md`; the unified gate emits an
  identity-bound QEMU soak result and preserves missing PCI qualification as
  `ENVIRONMENT-OPEN`.

## Capability maturity

| Area | Current maturity | Main gap |
|---|---|---|
| DPA/core state and transactions | Foundation complete; v0.16 Route/NH/NHGroup backend lifecycle contract frozen and conformance gate passes | Broader object families and platform-specific rollback semantics |
| WAL and restart recovery | Working baseline | Real-disk fsync and migration policy |
| Desired/programmed reconciliation | Route/NH/NHGroup add/delete, tombstone sweep and replay verified | Extend the frozen semantics to additional object families |
| gNMI/CLI/NETCONF | Strong prototype | Multi-stream edge cases, in-process TLS, long-term protocol maintenance |
| Linux backend | Real backend verified | Broader topology and recovery acceptance |
| VPP backend | Runtime/conformance, ECMP packet forwarding, 4000-packet QEMU soak and VPP restart/replay verified | Real PCI/DPDK performance and longer-duration soak |
| FRR integration | clean-source topology-140 verifies dynamic BGP add/withdraw, OSPF adjacency, ZAPI, FRR/zserv restart, VPP replay and ECMP NH withdraw/restore | Production hardening and BFD |
| Data model | Route/VRF/NH plus primary interface IPv4/IPv6 model | VLAN, multi-address, tunnel/EVPN models |
| Observability/security | Initial implementation | Operational semantics, HA and upgrade evidence |
| OVS/P4/platform | Intentionally deferred | Revisit after v0.16 release qualification; frozen contract is necessary but not sufficient |

## Direction and principles

1. Stabilize and verify the existing control-plane loop before broad protocol expansion.
2. Treat real privileged integration and traffic tests as release evidence, not optional demonstrations.
3. Keep the project value in DPA, state, transactions, reconciliation and backend semantics; reuse mature FRR protocols.
4. Prefer EVPN/SR over legacy VPLS/RSVP/ICCP, but enter EVPN only after tunnel, interface and L3 foundations are complete.
5. Make every feature traceable to code, test, documentation and a Definition of Done.

## Delivery roadmap

### v0.15 Engineering convergence

- Synchronize version/status documentation.
- Land and test the pending gNMI fixes as separate changes.
- Complete Route/NH/NHGroup dependency-aware deletion and retry behavior.
- Complete VPP interface-address messages and multi-address modeling.
- Keep the privileged CI lane green and classify unavailable capabilities as
  environment-blocked rather than code failures.
- Add formal fuzzing targets where the toolchain permits. The `DANOS_TSAN`
  option, libFuzzer target, CI jobs and gNMI concurrent validation are now
  present; this workspace lacks clang, so libFuzzer execution remains a CI
  verification item.
- Establish VPP runtime compatibility baselines. The WAL benchmark now accepts
  `DANOS_WAL_BENCH_PATH` and has a `/var/tmp` CI job for a real-filesystem run.
- Verify the OCI image through boot, configuration, restart and metrics smoke tests.

### v0.16 Minimal L3 NOS loop

Prove interface address, VRF, static route, next-hop, ECMP, BGP/OSPF route installation and withdrawal through gNMI/CLI, DPA, Linux/VPP and real traffic, including restart recovery.

Execution status:

- Interface primary IPv4/IPv6 model and Linux address programming: implemented
  and covered by model, pipeline and regression tests.
- VRF and IPv4 static route/NH/NHGroup pipeline: existing baseline covered by
  deterministic tests.
- ECMP northbound representation: implemented for gNMI `gateways[]`, DPA
  NHGroup creation/update/delete and verified in QEMU/VMware dataplane lanes;
  line-rate PCI distribution remains open.
- Real Linux namespace and traffic proof: blocked in this workspace because
  root/user namespaces are unavailable.
- VPP runtime boot, API/stat sockets and DPA conformance: verified in Debian
  trixie source-built runtime. Interface-address add/delete messages now have
  typed wire coverage and dual-stack adapter programming. The API client now
  reaches the live VPP route transaction, but the current software runtime
  rejects the FRR gateway route with `retval=-54` because it exposes only
  `local0` and no usable dataplane interface/path. The dedicated software
  topology now proves API-driven route, ECMP and packet forwarding; only the
  separate DPDK hardware lane remains open.
- FRR BGP/OSPF route installation and withdrawal through the full DPA/backend
  path: PASS in strict clean topology-110; the ZAPI mapper normalizes multipath route
  messages into multi-member DPA NHGroups and has regression coverage.
- The runnable `build/danos-test/fib_live_bridge` now connects a real FRR zebra
  socket, dispatches each message through the FIB mapper and DPA transaction,
  and drives the VPP adapter. Use `--messages N` for deterministic acceptance.
  The DPDK lane preflight is `danos-test/integration/run_vpp_dpdk_lane.sh`; it
  reports SKIP when no PCI/user-space driver is exposed and never treats a
  kernel or mock dataplane as DPDK evidence. It accepts `DPDK_PCI_DRIVER` as
  `vfio-pci`, `uio_pci_generic` or `igb_uio` for compatibility testing.

## Current v0.16 acceptance matrix

The authoritative current status is maintained in
`docs/v0.16-acceptance-matrix.md`. The older roadmap and historical notes
below are retained for traceability only; they are not a second source of
current completion status.

## Next-stage implementation plan

The project is now in integration closure rather than broad feature expansion.
The recommended order is:

1. Replace ad-hoc containers with a fixed Debian trixie FRR+VPP compose/test
   topology. Explicitly share `/run/vpp` and `/var/run/frr`, add readiness
   checks, preserve logs on failure, and keep zebra/VPP/bridge alive together.
2. The FRR 10.3 registration and route-notification path is now proven: the
   live bridge receives command 31 route events and enters the DPA transaction.
   Next, provide a VPP interface/path, then prove a single static add/withdraw
   first, followed by BGP/OSPF and ECMP. A replay message is not counted as
   route redistribution evidence.
3. Verify each route event through DPA and `vppctl show ip fib`, then run real
   traffic, withdraw, reconnect and restart recovery. A real FRR static
   two-next-hop replay now produces a VPP FIB load-balance with two resolved
   buckets (`172.17.0.1` and `172.17.0.3`). The bridge now invokes
   the programming sweep after each committed ZAPI transaction so deleted
   routes are withdrawn from VPP using the programmed ledger copy. With
   `--reconnect`, a live add/delete run processed two route transactions and
   the VPP FIB returned to its default drop entry after the sweep.
   A two-next-hop traffic topology using the trixie containers at `.3` and
   `.4` then produced two resolved FIB buckets and VPP ping to
   `203.0.113.10` completed 5/5 packets with zero loss.
   VPP restart replay logic is implemented. The acceptance harness now waits
   for `/run/vpp/api.sock`, reapplies the shared `0666` socket mode after a
   container restart, and fails explicitly if the socket remains unusable.
   The bridge also forgets stale programmed-ledger entries after a VPP
   handshake and replays desired routes; an idle health probe reproduced
   replay with `attempted=1 failed=0`.
4. Close Route/NH/NHGroup dependency deletion, tombstone, retry and rollback
   semantics, then repeat the lifecycle on Linux and VPP backends.
5. Run the dedicated DPDK lane only on a host exposing PCI/VFIO, hugepages and
   a loaded VPP DPDK plugin. The current software-forwarding result is a
   baseline, not DPDK evidence.

VMXNET3 is a valid option for this lane only when the test runner itself is a
VMware guest with a VMXNET3 PCI NIC (vendor/device `15ad:07b0`). It cannot be
created by mounting a driver or socket into a container. The lane preflight now
requires a real PCI Ethernet function and reports the VMXNET3 device when
present; the guest NIC must then be made available through the selected DPDK
binding/VFIO setup.
Containerized trixie runners can use
`danos-test/integration/run_vpp_dpdk_container_lane.sh`; the current runner
emits a structured `SKIP` because the expected privileged container is absent.
The host exposes only the Realtek `10ec:8168` RTL8111/8168 path, which is not
a validated VPP DPDK PMD in this project. A future privileged runner must
provide a supported PCI function, VPP binary/plugin, HugePages and traffic
generator; changing a kernel binding alone is not sufficient.
The checked-in software validation image intentionally contains
`plugins { plugin dpdk_plugin.so { disable } }`; enabling it is reserved for
the dedicated PCI/VFIO runner and is not mixed into the software baseline.
The dedicated startup template is
`danos-test/integration/vpp-dpdk-startup.conf`; its BDF must match the
runner-selected VFIO-bound device before launch.

QEMU/KVM VMXNET3 DPDK was tested with VPP 26.10 and remains a recorded FAIL:
the device is exposed but VPP DPDK initialization SIGSEGVs across pc/q35 and
single/dual-port variants. VMware Workstation provides the accepted
polling-only alternative via `no-rx-interrupts`; its dual-subnet packet gate
and repeatable pps verifier pass, but it is not line-rate evidence.

The same ISO has now passed a QEMU `e1000` network smoke test using the
project-bundled `e1000.ko`: guest `eth0` received `10.0.2.15/24`, the link
reported 1000 Mbps full duplex, and the kernel FIB contained the user-mode NAT
default route. This confirms that a non-VMXNET3 QEMU NIC can test the DANOS
live networking path; it does not count as VPP/DPDK evidence because the ISO
still reports `VPP not reachable`.

A QEMU `virtio-net-pci` boot initially exposed missing `net_failover` and
`failover` module dependencies. The ISO builder now includes the available
dependency modules (and tolerates kernel-built-in variants); the rebuilt ISO
successfully creates `eth0` and configures `10.0.2.15/24` under QEMU
virtio-net. Both e1000 and virtio-net are now validated generic QEMU NICs.

The archived DANOS dataplane confirms the historical fallback: its
`vyatta-dataplane/tools/vplane-uio` selects `vfio-pci` when IOMMU groups are
safe and falls back to `uio_pci_generic` when a group overlaps storage; the
`dpdk-kmods` source separately packages `igb_uio` as DKMS. The same source
contains VMXNET3 device support (`15ad:07b0`) and the image includes
`librte-net-vmxnet3-25`, making a VMware VMXNET3 guest the correct remaining
DPDK acceptance target.

The repeatable socket-level driver is
`danos-test/integration/run_frr_zapi_vpp.sh`. It classifies missing FRR/VPP
sockets as `BLOCKED`, invokes the same `fib_live_bridge` binary used by the
integration build, and reports success only after the bridge has processed the
requested message count. The caller must supplement this with `vppctl` FIB
inspection and packet traffic evidence.

The v0.16 Definition of Done is a reproducible FRR BGP/OSPF route
installation and withdrawal trace from ZAPI through DPA to the real VPP FIB,
including traffic, restart and deletion evidence. OVS/P4, broad model growth
and additional protocol work remain deferred until this loop is stable.

The bridge sends the FRR v6 `ZEBRA_HELLO` registration using the official
10-byte zserv header, and `zapi_parse_frr()` has a regression-tested parser for
that header. The FRR-native route payload decoder is connected to the live
session; redistribute route notifications use the distinct FRR v6 commands
  31/32 rather than the client-originated route commands 9/10. The live session
requests router-id/interface replay and IPv4/IPv6 connected, static, OSPF and
BGP notifications. The remaining gap is a usable VPP dataplane path and
privileged route lifecycle evidence: real add/withdraw, ECMP, VPP FIB
inspection and traffic. The current socket-connected runtime receives the FRR
route and enters DPA. The adapter accepts an explicit
`DANOS_VPP_IFINDEX_MAP=linux_ifindex:vpp_sw_if_index,...` mapping for
namespace-local interface IDs; with `2:1` in the current FRR/VPP host-
interface topology, the same route reaches VPP and is installed. The mapping
is a topology requirement, not a ZAPI registration failure.
The Debian trixie FRR 10.3 runtime uses `/var/run/frr/zserv.api` as the
default zserv socket; the session and acceptance harness now use that path,
while explicit socket overrides remain supported.

### v0.17 Backend semantic consistency

Freeze capability discovery, idempotency, error, retry, partial-programming and rollback contracts, then apply the same DPA conformance suite to Linux, VPP and a subsequent OVS backend.

### Later

Add VLAN/QinQ, BFD translation, VXLAN and EVPN, followed by HA, upgrade/rollback, scale and only then P4/legacy compatibility work.

## Acceptance policy

Every stage must report four separate results:

- Local deterministic tests.
- Sanitizer/concurrency tests.
- Privileged integration tests with FRR, namespaces or VPP.
- External interoperability and real traffic tests.

An environment restriction must be recorded as `blocked by environment`; it must not be silently counted as pass or fail. A release cannot claim a real dataplane feature until the corresponding privileged and traffic evidence exists.

## 2026-09-22 progress update

FRR 10.3 ifindex-only nexthops are now decoded without fabricating a gateway
address. The VPP encoder correspondingly emits `FIB_PATH_TYPE_API_ATTACHED`
for a zero gateway, preventing VPP from attempting an ARP/probe for
`0.0.0.0`; non-zero gateways retain the normal recursive path. Regression
coverage now includes both the FRR type-2 gateway payload and the attached
VPP path wire encoding. The local build and all 34 CTest cases pass, and the
changes are pushed as `a05df70` and `c119960`.

The next privileged acceptance step is route add/withdraw against a VPP
instance with a socket accessible to the host bridge process, followed by
`vppctl` FIB inspection and packet traffic. The previous runtime attempt was
blocked by the mounted socket permissions (`VPP adapter setup failed:
Permission denied`), so this is an environment harness issue rather than a
counted dataplane pass. Use the standard integration harness with explicit
socket ownership/permissions, then test ECMP, restart recovery and deletion.

The VPP API gate has since been corrected against the Debian trixie VPP
26.10 generated `fib_types.api`: the path contains `rpf_id`, u32 type/flags/
proto fields and a 28-byte nexthop union. Zero-gateway FRR ifindex-only paths
use `FIB_API_PATH_FLAG_RESOLVE_VIA_ATTACHED`; the former malformed layout was
causing VPP message truncation or SIGSEGV. With a VPP tap interface (`tap0`,
sw_if_index 1) and `DANOS_VPP_IFINDEX_MAP=2:1`, a real FRR 10.3
`ZEBRA_FRR_REDISTRIBUTE_ROUTE_ADD` reached VPP successfully:
`processed=1 failed=0`, and `vppctl show ip fib` showed the attached route.
The corrected encoder and regression test are pushed as `4596e90`; all 34
local tests pass.

The remaining live gap is a distinct FRR route-delete notification: the
standard static route add/replay is observed, but the current FRR container
run did not emit a command-32 event after `no ip route`, so the VPP route
withdraw cannot yet be claimed. This is now isolated to FRR registration/
staticd notification behavior, not VPP framing or route-add programming.

The delete gate was subsequently reproduced with the bridge `--reconnect`
mode, which keeps the ZAPI session alive across FRR idle/EOF transitions.
The trace contained a real `zapi command=32` for the static route,
`programming sweep: withdrawn=1 failed=0`, and the final VPP FIB lookup had
only the default drop path. This proves the FRR→DPA→VPP add/withdraw
lifecycle for the tested route; reconnect mode is required for this
containerized FRR runtime because zebra closes the client socket during its
idle transition.

ECMP was also exercised with two FRR static nexthops for
`203.0.113.0/24`. VPP reported two attached paths (`172.17.0.1` and
`172.17.0.2`, both on `tap0`) and a `dpo-load-balance` with two buckets; the
subsequent command-32 withdrawal removed the programmed route. This is
control-plane/FIB ECMP evidence; packet distribution still requires a
two-port privileged lane and remains separate from this socket-level result.

The live recovery race is now handled by bounded replay retries after the
VPP API reconnect. In the privileged test, VPP was restarted, `tap0` was
recreated, and the bridge replayed the desired route ledger until
`198.51.100.0/24` reappeared in the VPP FIB; the run completed with
`processed=2 failed=0`. This closes the software socket-level restart gate;
the persistent-interface variant still belongs to the QEMU/DPDK lane.

The QEMU e1000 two-port ISO lane was rebuilt after correcting the VPP 26.10
socket-server configuration to `socksvr { default }`; the unsupported
`api-listen` directive had prevented `api.sock` creation. With
`-enable-kvm -cpu host`, the guest reports both `/run/vpp/api.sock` and
`stats.sock` ready, both `GigabitEthernet0/2/0` and `GigabitEthernet0/3/0`
up, the `30.30.30.0/24` two-next-hop FIB, and mgrd connected to VPP. DPDK
reports flow-offload error `-38` for QEMU e1000 and disables only flow
offload; the ports and control-plane FIB remain operational. The rebuilt
artifact is `build/danos-vpp-dpdk-e1000-2port-api2.iso`.

The ISO now has an opt-in traffic gate (`VPP_DPDK_TRAFFIC_TEST=1`). The
resulting `build/danos-vpp-dpdk-e1000-2port-traffic.iso` was booted with
QEMU user peers on `10.10.0.0/24` and `10.20.0.0/24`; VPP reported
`VPP-DPDK-PING-0 PASS` and `VPP-DPDK-PING-1 PASS` for three probes each.
Both DPDK e1000 interfaces were up while the two-path ECMP FIB was present.
This closes the basic two-port packet reachability gate; flow-offload error
`-38` remains a QEMU emulation limitation and is explicitly downgraded by
VPP without disabling the ports.

The host DPDK preflight remains explicitly blocked: no host `vpp` binary is
available, only 19 hugepages exist and all are consumed, and the idle
Realtek PCI Ethernet function `04:00.0` (`10ec:8168`) is still owned by the
kernel `r8169` driver. It has not been rebound automatically because doing so
requires privileged host PCI state changes. The QEMU e1000 lane remains the
reproducible software DPDK acceptance path.

## 2026-09-22 execution update

The authoritative v0.16 matrix is maintained in
`docs/v0.16-acceptance-matrix.md`. Since the previous update:

- F1/F2 runner argument handling was corrected; real three-node FRR BGP and
  OSPF runs now report one executed test and one pass each.
- `docs/backend-contract-v0.16.md` freezes backend lifecycle, idempotency,
  error/retry, tombstone deletion, restart replay and observability semantics.
- `danos-test/integration/run_backend_contract.sh` passes DPA conformance,
  programming pipeline and composite route/NH/NHGroup lifecycle gates.
- `danos-test/integration/run_frr_dynamic_vpp.sh` provides the explicit BGP
  and OSPF ZAPI-to-VPP gate. It requires externally provisioned FRR and VPP
  sockets and returns BLOCKED when `zserv.api` or `api.sock` is absent; it
  never treats an empty event stream as a pass.
- QEMU traffic mode now records interface counters before and after peer
  probes. Distribution remains PARTIAL until a remote multi-flow generator
  can drive the two ECMP next hops.

Latest pushed commits: `88e1f5c` (backend contract gate) and `656713b`
(dynamic FRR/VPP gate). Current environment blockers are the missing FRR
`/var/run/frr/zserv.api`, missing host VPP runtime for the real PCI DPDK lane,
and the absence of a privileged remote multi-flow QEMU topology.

## 2026-09-25 execution update

The QEMU topology-16 run is the current authoritative live evidence. With
Debian trixie, FRR 10.3 and the dual-port VPP ISO, the FRR route cycle returned
`add-rc=0`, `withdraw-rc=0`, and `restore-rc=0`. DANOS recorded
`command=31 -> VPP route add`, `command=32 -> VPP route delete`, and a final
`command=31 -> VPP route add`, with no programming failure or zserv EOF.

The live ISO now subscribes to FRR route types `4,9` (static and BGP); the
previous `3` value was incompatible with FRR 10.3 static notifications. The
next gates remain ECMP multi-flow distribution and restart recovery, followed
by BGP/OSPF neighbor validation.

Topology-26 closes the real QEMU VPP process-restart gate: the guest emitted
`VPP-RESTART-TEST PASS` after SIGTERM, API socket recreation and route lookup;
the bridge concurrently reported `replay attempted=1 failed=0`.
